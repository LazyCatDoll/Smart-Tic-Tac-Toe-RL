# Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe-RL

LazyCatDoll's project that operates Java along with BURLAP reinforcement learning library to play an enhanced game of Tic-Tac-Toe

With some advice and guidance, we've applied a Tac-Tac-Toe Q-Learning example utilizing BURLAP 3 libraries. It follows the concepts as described by Sutton and Barto in the 'An Extended Example: Tic-Tac-Toe' part. The application is released under the Apache 2 license, and we encourage collaboration for enhancements. In the current state, the LearningAgent acts as 'X' and always makes the first move. The 'O' player strategy is quite simple and can be easily beaten, paving the way for 'X' to become progressively better.
