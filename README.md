# Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe-RL

LazyCatDoll's project that operates Java along with BURLAP reinforcement learning library to play an enhanced game of Tic-Tac-Toe

With some advice and guidance, we've applied a Tac-Tac-Toe Q-Learning example utilizing BURLAP 3 libraries. It follows the concepts as described by Sutton and Barto in the 'An Extended Example: Tic-Tac-Toe' part. The application is released under the Apache 2 license, and we encourage collaboration for enhancements. In the current state, the LearningAgent acts as 'X' and always makes the first move. The 'O' player strategy is quite simple and can be easily beaten, paving the way for 'X' to become progressively better.

The project is hosted on GitHub at:
https://github.com/LazyCatDoll/Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe-RL

The Q-Learning algorithm can be leveraged by running the TicTacToeQLearning.java program. Interaction with VisualExplorer can be achieved via the TicTacToeWorld.java

Future enhancements that are planned include a varied range of strategies for 'O', visual improvements, visualizations of the Q-Learning table and more.

Participation, suggestions and collaborations are most welcome.

Regards,
LazyCatDoll
